I am currently a software engineer at Google Cloud LLM DevX team. Before this job, I received my PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado, Boulder,  advised by [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). 
Further before that, I graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distinction.

Outside of works, I am passionate about skiing and hiking. My favorite ski resorts are Big Sky and Snowbird/Alta so far.
