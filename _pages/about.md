I am a third year Ph.D. student from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder.
I have been bestowed with the privilege of receiving guidance and mentorship from [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). 
I graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distrinction.

Research Interest
======
My academic pursuits encompass a spectrum spanning from **uncertainty quantification** to the **probabilistic machine learning** and **randomized algorithm**. 
My intellectual curiosity is primarily directed towards crafting innovative algorithms to facilitate robust modeling of uncertainties within the realm of high-dimensional and large-scale settings.

At present, I am deeply engrossed in research projects that involve the development of deep generative models, such as variational auto-encoders (VAE), to efficaciously estimate the propagation of uncertainties in physical models. 
Additionally, I am also investigating the practicalities of conducting derivative-free optimization of black-box functions through information-theoretic approaches.

It is my ultimate goal to devise novel methodologies that are well-balanced in terms of both theoretical underpinnings and empirical performance, thereby contributing towards the advancement of scientific inquiry.

**I am looking for a 2023 summer intership opportunity.**
