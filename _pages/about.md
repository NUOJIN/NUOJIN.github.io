I am a third year Ph.D. student from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder.
My advisors are [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). 
I graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distinction.

Research Interest
======
My academic pursuits range from **uncertainty quantification** to **probabilistic machine learning** and **randomized algorithm**. 
My intellectual curiosity is primarily directed toward designing algorithms to facilitate the modeling of uncertainties under high-dimensional and large-scale settings.

My current research projects involve the development of **deep generative models**, such as variational auto-encoders (VAE), to efficaciously estimate the propagation of uncertainties in physical models. 
I am also investigating the practicalities of conducting derivative-free optimization of black-box functions through an information-theoretic approach.

My ultimate goal is to devise novel methodologies that are well-balanced in terms of both theoretical interpretation and empirical performance, thereby contributing towards the advancement of our community.
