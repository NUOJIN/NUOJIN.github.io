I am currently a 4th year Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder.
My advisors are [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/), who are two great people to work with. 
I graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distinction.

I am inclined to think the world in a *probabilistic* way, especially enjoy working on problems in the presense of *uncertainty* and potentially *multi-fideity*. Most of my research works focus on designing clever algorithms in *statistical inference* and *optimization*. 

Outside of my research, I am passionate about skiing and hiking. Living in Colorado bestows me with opportunities to explore some of the most stunning mountains and ski resorts. Among them, Big Sky and Snowbird/Alta remain my favorites, despite them both being outside Colorado; (
