I am a third year Ph.D. student from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder.
My advisors are [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). 
I graduated from University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distinction.

Research Interest
======
My academic pursuits range from **uncertainty quantification** to **probabilistic machine learning** and **randomized algorithm**. 
I am interested in developing algorithms for uncertainty modeling and applying randomized algorithms to downscale large physical systems. 
My current research projects involve applying deep generative models (e.g. variational auto-encoder) for UQ, importance sampling, and Langevin Monte Carlo. 
My ultimate goal is to devise novel methodologies that are well-balanced in terms of both theoretical interpretation and empirical performance, thereby contributing towards the advancement of our community.

**I am an intern in the Shell AI research group this summer**
