I am a 4th year Ph.D. student from the Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Colorado, Boulder.
My advisors are [Prof. Alireza Doostan](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/alireza-doostan) and [Prof. Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/). 
I graduated from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities in 2020, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics with high distinction.

**I am actively looking for 2024 summer internship opportunities.**

Research Interest
======
I am primarily interested in exploring the following areas:

- **Uncertainty Quantification**

- **Multi-fidelity Modeling**

- **Probabilistic Numerics**

The central problem I aim to address is

**How can we effectively utilize less accurate data sources and scarce high-fidelity data to construct a reliable model?**

To address this challenge, I have been working on

- Employing *boosting* method on multi-fidelity modeling:
    - Built weak learner from low-fidelity model
    - Boosted a strong learner embodied by a bi-fidelity model
- Leveraging *variational auto-encoder* (VAE) to establish a latent probabilistic regression from low-fidelity to high-fidelity:
    - Introduced the bi-fidelity evidence lower bound (BF-ELBO)
    - Established a connection with the principle of information bottleneck

Currently, I am actively working on a *Langevin-based Monte Carlo* strategy for estimating high-fidelity statistical properties with a reduced mean square error by leveraging insights from the low-fidelity model.
